description: Get started quickly with the Realtime Python SDK
---



This guide helps you get started with the **Realtime Python SDK** to send and receive messages via the Realtime API.

## üì¶ Install the SDK

Install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soketlabs/realtime-sdk-python.git
cd realtime-sdk-python
pip install .
```

## üöÄ Basic Usage

Below is a minimal example to connect, send a message, and receive responses using the Python SDK.  
This example is adapted from [`connect.py`](https://github.com/soketlabs/realtime-sdk-python/blob/main/connect.py).

```python
import os
from realtime.client import RealtimeClient

# Set your API key (recommended: use environment variable)
API_KEY = os.environ.get("TENSOR_STUDIO_API_KEY")

client = RealtimeClient(
    api_key=API_KEY,
)

# Change language and voice settings
client.update_session(
    voice="monica",
    language="en",
)

def on_response(event):
    print("Received:", event)

# Register a callback for responses
client.on("conversation.updated", on_response)

# Connect to the service
await client.connect()

# Send a text message
client.send_user_message_content(
    content = [{
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Hello, this is a test message from the Realtime API!"
    }]
)


```

## üõ†Ô∏è More Examples

- See the [connect.py example](https://github.com/soketlabs/realtime-sdk-python/blob/main/connect.py) for a full script.
- Explore advanced features like tool-calling and VAD in the [Realtime SDK Python repo](https://github.com/soketlabs/realtime-sdk-python/tree/main).

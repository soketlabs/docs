Welcome to TensorStudio’s SDK Quickstart guide—your gateway to integrating real‑time voice intelligence into your applications effortlessly. With this SDK, you can:

- Seamlessly add human-like conversational AI via voice or text.
- Integrate with diverse infrastructures—from web and mobile apps to backend systems.
- Use `NodeJS SDK` or `Python SDK` as per your application needs.
- Enable tool‑calling so your agent can perform actions and fetch data autonomously.
- Capture interaction logs and transcripts for analysis, monitoring, and optimization.


In just a few simple steps, you can:

1. **Install the SDK and authenticate.**
2. **Configure core settings** like VAD, voice styles, models, and temperature.
3. **Connect and enable real‑time interaction** or asynchronous flows.
4. **Access transcripts, function‑call events, and analytics.**
5. **Disconnect when testing is complete and review logs.**

Whether you're building customer‑support bots, voice‑enabled assistants, or internal workflows, TensorStudio provides the tools you need to create natural, responsive, and intelligent voice experiences.

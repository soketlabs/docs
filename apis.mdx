## Introduction

The Soket's Realtime Speech API, built on OpenAI's protocol, enables implementation of conversational AI capabilities through [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), a widely supported protocol optimized for real-time server-to-server data transfer. This guide demonstrates how to establish WebSocket connections and interact with Realtime models. WebRTC support for browser and mobile clients will be available in an upcoming release.

## Access Your API Key

1. Log in to your TensorStudio account.
2. Navigate to the [API Keys](https://app.tensorstudio.ai/studio/api-keys) section under manage.
